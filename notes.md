# Deploying to Netlify

Now you can publish your Gatsby site straight from GitHub to Netlify from the create site page - the proper build command for Gatsby will be provided automatically, just select your GitHub repo and go with the default options. Once you connect your GitHub repo to Netlify, deployment will begin. Note that the first deployment could take a few minutes since a lot of things aren’t cached yet. Subsequent deploys will be faster.

Once deployment is complete you’ll be able to view your live site, which should look the same as it did locally.

# issues

- if you add a build script 'gatsby build' folder 'public' it will fail
