      <Subtitle>What is Ankylosing Spondylitis</Subtitle>
      <p>
        Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a painful progressive inflammatory
        arthritis. It mainly affects the spine, but other joints, tendons,
        ligaments and organs such as the eyes, skin and heart may also be
        involved.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        AS is part of a larger group of related disorders called
        spondyloarthropathies. This includes Psoriatic Arthritis, Reactive
        Arthritis, Arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and an
        undifferentiated arthritis. These conditions have many similarities to
        AS, but differ in some presentations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The affects of AS vary from one person to the next. The spine is usually
        most affected, especially the neck and lower back, with the initial
        onset often in the sacroiliac joints. Restricted, painful movement is
        common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common symptoms include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gradual onset of back pain and stiffness over weeks or months (often
            in the lower back, buttocks and/or legs)
          </li>
          <li>
            Interrupted sleep, especially in the early hours of the morning, due
            to back pain and stiffness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Early morning stiffness and pain, which improves with movement
            during the day.
          </li>
          <li>Worsening stiffness and pain after rest.</li>
          <li>Persistence of stiffness and pain for more than 3 months</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other symptoms may include weight loss (in the early stages), fever and
        night sweats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symptoms of AS often become apparent in the late teens and twenties.
        Men, women and children can all have AS, however, it is slightly more
        common in males (2.5/1)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early stages of AS, most of the pain and stiffness is caused by
        inflammation. This is often acute, sharp, disabling pain – especially
        when walking, standing on one leg or rolling over in bed. This often
        makes it very difficult to move and many are frightened of hurting
        themselves more, so tend to rest and avoid movement. This only makes it
        worse, and makes the pain last longer. It is important to keep moving as
        much as possible and resume full activity as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people with AS experience episodic flares of spinal pain and a slow
        decline in spinal flexibility. Repeated bouts of inflammation can lead
        to bony changes in the spine and the tendons and ligaments which support
        it. This may lead to joining together of some of the vertebra – fusion
        of the spine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the later stages, limitation of spinal mobility is a greater symptom
        than the pain, and the pain that is felt is usually of a less severe and
        more chronic nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        AS is different in all people. Some people have little or no fusion of
        their spine, even after many years of having AS, whereas others may have
        significant changes.

      <Subtitle>What if I have Ankylosing Spondylitis?</Subtitle>
      <p>
        The course of AS is very variable. If your AS is diagnosed early and
        treated appropriately, you will generally do well.
      </p>
      <p>
        How your disease progresses over the first 10 years usually gives a
        guide to how you are likely to do in future years.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are diagnosed with AS, it is important to develop a plan to
        manage the condition successfully. AS can be managed with a combination
        of medicines and specific exercises to relieve pain, maintain mobility
        and a correct posture, so that you can continue to do your normal daily
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your GP should send you to a rheumatologist to confirm an accurate
        diagnosis. The rheumatologist can discuss treatment options such as
        regular exercise and the use of medicines.
      </p>
      <p>
        A referral to a physiotherapist with some knowledge of AS is important
        to help you get the best information about ways to help you manage your
        pain, your daily activities, posture, sport and recreation. Exercise is
        essential to the successful management of AS, and a physio can tailor an
        exercise program to your specific needs, especially including stretching
        and flexibility exercises and postural strengthening. They can help with
        mobilisation techniques and other physical and electrical techniques if
        required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hydrotherapy – exercises in the water – is extremely helpful for people
        with AS. The water gives a greater freedom of movement and helps relieve
        pain, hence enabling more movement with greater ease. ‘less pain – more
        gain!’
      </p>
      <p>
        A psychologist may be helpful to help you and your family to adjust to
        your diagnosis. Stress has a significant effect on flare-ups of your
        condition and hence how much pain and disability you feel. Psychologists
        can help you manage stress, motivate you to exercise and guide and help
        you to self manage your condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Healthcare professionals can provide advice, support and treatment. You
        are important, as the centre of a health team. Your condition needs to
        be monitored and reviewed. It is important to keep in contact with your
        medical support team. Regular visits to your rheumatologist are
        important to ensure that your disease is under control and that the best
        medicines are being used safely and appropriately. Regular reviews by
        your physiotherapist are important to ensure that your exercise program
        is the best for you at that time, and that deterioration in your
        mobility is prevented or minimised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your needs will vary over time and your healthcare professionals are the
        best people to assist you to improve your quality of life. Your GP can
        help you coordinate your care. He/she can assess if you are eligible for
        a ‘care plan’, which means you can access several physio or other allied
        health treatments under Medicare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people with AS keep active, keep working and live full lives with
        sport, recreation and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the disease, and knowing what you can do for yourself,
        will contribute to successful management of the condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Support groups are a valuable resource – providing support, information
        and social interaction.
